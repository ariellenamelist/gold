              We take security seriously and for that reason, we enforce
              industry-grade security. Here are 7 major security concerns that
              our platform addresses:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>1. Industry-grade Encryption Standards:</strong> Gold365
              uses 256-bit SSL encryption to protect your data as it travels
              between your device and our servers. On top of it, all servers
              have advanced server-level encryption that makes it even harder to
              break in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Most Secure Payment Gateway:</strong> Whether itâ€™s
              banks, UPI, or e-wallets, go through trusted gateways with PCI DSS
              compliance. This all ensures that when you enter your card details
              or bank details, they are handled strictly and encrypted during
              transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. 7G Firewall:</strong> A 7-layer security system gives
              our servers full protection from any data breaches. We also got
              international certifications like ISO/IEC 27001:2013. Payment data
              passes through encryption, tokenization, and authentication.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>4. Account Protection:</strong> You get built-in security
              tools and a 2-step authentication option to guard your account
              from fraud.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>5. Anti-cheat System:</strong> Our developers have
              deployed anti-cheat functions to our web servers. This does two
              things:
            </p>
            <div style={{ paddingLeft: 30 }}>
              <p>(a) Detects unusual clicks and patterns</p>
              <p>
                (b) Detects any third-party application that can play on behalf
                of a human.
              </p>
              <p>
                This all ensures that only humans are behind the screen that
                places bets.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>6. Anti-Bot detection:</strong> Developers also ensure no
              bots can enter our platform, which is backed by Cloudflare bot
              protection and our anti-bot detection system. Cloudflare prevents
              bots from entering the site (by displaying captchas), and even
              when a bot enters the website, our second anti-bot system
              completely blocks it when it tries to place bets.{" "}

            <p>
              <strong>7. Legally Licensed &amp; Regulated Operations:</strong>{" "}
              Gold365 holds a full license, and independent monitors check
              operations for transparency. Your betting history and account
              details stay protected by industry standards.{" "}
